# How to approach coding problem

1. Donâ€™t jump to solve the question since you have seen it before
2. Always ask clarifying questions to 
   1. understand the question
   2. get the corner cases
3. Write the template
   1. Write the API signature
   2. Come up with example inputs, output
4. Talk about brute force algorithm
5. Talk about improving it
6. Implement optimal algorithm
7. Do a dry run of the code
    1. Check corner cases
8. Run the solution
