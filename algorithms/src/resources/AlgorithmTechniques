n*2 
- Nested for loop, 
- while
- Three pointers, outer pointer - O(n) with (left and right right pointer) O(n)- e.g three sum,  

n log n 

priority queue - n * (log n) 
Sorting
Sorting + binary search
Sorting Comparable objects

n
One traversal + cache value
Two traversal - one potential - one validation
Two pointers
	- slow and fast runners
	- opposite ends
two pass - one from right, one from left
Shuffling

log n
Binary search
