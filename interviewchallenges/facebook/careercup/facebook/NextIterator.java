Given K sorted (ascending) arrays. Write an iterator class that iterate over the arrays and returns the next element. Duplicate are allowed. What is the complexity to iterate the entire arrays? what is the complexity for each iteration? 
		
Example:

	arr1 = {1,2,3,4,7,9}
	arr2 = {3,5,6,8,10}

The iterator should return:

1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Extension: 
Don't return duplicates, so the above iterator should return:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

public class NextIterator {
