Flatten a linked list. 
Each node in the list carries a piece of data and a pointer.
 The data could be in a normal data type such as an integer, or a pointer that points to another list node. 

The interviewer gave no specification on how the list node class was defined. 
You may look at each list node as if it has two pointers - one of them points to the next node;
 the other points to the ‘data’ which could be either a node or an integer. 
 There also needs to be a function to tell you about the node data is actual data or a pointer. 
I solved the problem with recursion. During the process, any nodes that don’t carry an integer get removed.
