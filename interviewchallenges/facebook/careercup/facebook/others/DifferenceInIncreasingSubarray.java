Given an array of integers and k, find the difference between the number of the strictly increasing number of subarrays (of size more than one) and the number of the strictly decreasing subarray in the window of size k. your method should be time and space efficent 
example 
int[] nums = {188930, 194123, 201345, 154243, 154243}; 
int k = 3; 
Output 
3, 0, -1 
Explanation 
For the first window of [188930, 194123, 201345], there are 3 increasing subranges ([188930, 194123, 201345], [188930, 194123], and [194123, 201345]) and 0 decreasing, so the answer is 3. For the second window of [194123, 201345, 154243], there is 1 increasing subrange and 1 decreasing, so the answer is 0. For the third window of [201345, 154243, 154243], there is 1 decreasing subrange and 0 increasing, so the answer is -1.
