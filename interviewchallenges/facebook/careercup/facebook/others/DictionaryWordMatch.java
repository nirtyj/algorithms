Find all words [A-Z] in a dictionary (about 1M words) that are made of a subset (in any order) of the chars in the input parameter [A-Z]. 
ex: input "ACRAT" (10 to 20 chars, up to 30 worst case) 
matching words: "A", "CAR", "ACA", "ART", "RAC". 
non-matching words: "BAR", "AAA" 

follow up : the input is a list of words. Return a list of words that each 
list is formed by exactly the characters in the input list. 
For example: two lists {“DEBIT”, “CARD”} and{“BAD”, “CREDIT”} 
are formed by the same exact group of characters.
