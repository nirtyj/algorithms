How would you work with a backend engineer to design a news feed on mobile. Imagine that we only care about showing the user feed and posting a picture. 

Follow-ups 
1. what kind of apis would you want him to expose and what would they look like 
2. How would you refresh the news feed on the iOS app and how often? 
3. How would you cache the data/images. What size cache would you have?

Design news feed. 
A user wrote a post with the basic user info, pictures and time etc (I even drafted a basic UI on whiteboard). 
How to obtain these information and store them. 
If a new feature with a button is added. How to maintain availability of old service to users who did not update the app. 
Did not dive further into scaling.
