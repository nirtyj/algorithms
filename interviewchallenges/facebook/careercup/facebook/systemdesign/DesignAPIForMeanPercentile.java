Make 100 HTTP GET requests to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page and print the following statistics for the response time to stdout: 

• 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th, 99th Percentile 

• Mean 

• Standard Deviation 

Your solution must be parallel. You must make at least N (say 10, but should be configurable). Use ExecutorService in Java for making the requests at a time. 

Explain design choices, known limitations and edge cases. 

What challenges did you face? How would you improve the code if you had more time?
