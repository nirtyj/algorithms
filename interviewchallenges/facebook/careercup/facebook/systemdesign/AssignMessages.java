Design and implement an algorithm to assign an unlimited M number of messages evenly among N number of servers (N will not change). 
Input to the algorithm 
A message contains a message identifier and a text string. The algorithm will be fed one message at a time. 
There are N numbers of servers (N will not change), each can be identified by a unique id. 
Output of the algorithm 
When the algorithm is called to process a message, it should output the id of the server that the message is assigned to.
