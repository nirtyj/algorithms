Given a binary tree that complies to the following rule: 
The parent node value is always the the result of the AND operator of its children values. 

You modify one of the LEAF nodes value (e.g. if it was 1 it is now 0). Write a function that fixes the tree 
so it complies with the above rule.


//
//        0                                 1
//      /   \                             /   \
//    1      0            =====>         1     1
//   / \    / \                         / \   / \
//  1   1  0   1                       1   1 1   1
//
// The parent node value is always children value's LOGICAL AND
//   &
