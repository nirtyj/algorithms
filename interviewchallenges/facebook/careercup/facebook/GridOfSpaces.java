Define a class 'Space' which has a member string variable that indicates if the space is a "tree", a "house" or an empty space and another member variable that will store the 'space neighbors' (left, right, up and down only) 

Given a 'Grid' (list) of Spaces write the code for the findAll(start) method to find all the trees and houses given a 'Space' as start point 

Example, Grid of 'Spaces': 

T 0 0 H 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
H H T H 0 

Where Ts are trees and Hs are houses

public class GridOfSpaces {
