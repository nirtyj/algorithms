	Given an array of integers, return the index of the max value in this array. 

			Note: 
			If the max value appears more than once, the function should return one the indexes, but make it so that the next call will return different index. 

			Important: you are not allowed to store state between calls 

			Example: given this input array


			//   0     -1     6    4   5    6      6
//			                |             |      |
//			               2,1/3       5,1/3     6,1/3
			Function signature:


			int getIndex(const std::vector<int>& numbers);
			Example output:


			2
			5
			6
			5
			2
			Extension: 
			What if you knew how many times the max value appears in the array, can you improve the function performance? 

			So using the given example array, the function signature is now:


			int getIndex(const std::vector<int>& numbers, int maxCount);

		You have a array with integers:
		[ 1, -2, 0, 6, 2, -4, 6, 6 ]
		You need to write a function which will evenly return indexes of a max value in the array. 
		In the example below max value is 6, and its positions are 3, 6 and 7. So each run function should return random index from the set. 
		
		Try to implement with O(n) for computation and memory. 
		Try to reduce memory complexity to O(1).
