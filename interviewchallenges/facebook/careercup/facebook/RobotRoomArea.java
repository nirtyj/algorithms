FB on-site two weeks ago last round of coding . (This problem is also in the internal question bank of G.) 

There is a robot in a room. The initial location of the robot is unknown. The shape or area of the room is unknown. 
You have a remote that could walk the robot into any of the four directions - up, left, down or right. 
Here is the move method: boolean move(int direction), direction: 0, 1, 2, 3. If the robot hits the wall, the method returns false. 
Otherwise returns true and the robot moves on to the direction given. 
Find out the area of the room. 


e.g. 
X 
XXX X 
XXXXX 'X' marks the floor plan of the room. 

A room like such has an area of 10.
