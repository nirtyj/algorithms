	 * electrical side: Leetcode (Letter Combination of a phone number) small deformation of the leetcode words certainly no problem
Should write recursive and BFS two kinds of links. Point point 垱 垱 垱 镊 1point3acres璁潧潧 onsite:


round 1: Chinese big brother two Leetcode: trading stocks (I) and minimum size subarray sum 
round 2: machine learning sy stem design !!!! I very much doubt that this round of kneeling behind will say hr feedback
I am not doing machine learning on a course, very basic regression, SVM, kNN and RBF really
Only know the concept There is no other experience The problem is: Design a focus in the machine learning system to advertise to the user
Basically there is now a pile of a pile of advertising and how users design a machine learning system can be very smart to one Juan € Bang - Juan For additional information He - Shi Ren help stirrup  Right-Caikan
user recommendations he wants advertising

My basic idea is to find feature and train Then use the testing data to verify the model casually pulled about what I know
cross validation interviewer is a big cow so what I'm talking about is so weak that people do not even think they've been playing cell phones

Round 3: chatting with manager talk about the ideal behavior why want to fb

round 4: coding a question: next permutation This topic is not in the fb leetcode pay to write a more naive way . From: 1point3acres . com / bbs 
Also wrote the best interviewer is a Chinese small brother Very nice has been quite satisfied Although I did a problem but the feeling of exchange and ideas are also good --google 1point3acres
so there is no concern or someone can be correct: fb hope every round of coding are instant answer? This can be done two questions?

round 5: system design design a system user to enter two words sunny AND day or sunny OR day return all users
status, asked to meet the status there are these two words This before prepared to talk about the data about the scale Talk about inverted index 
Next is the map reduce But do not know why the interviewer fell asleep. . . . . . .

Many details there is no way to write clearly after all, at least 45 minutes for each round? We have a problem you can leave a message I will reply as soon as possible
. From: 1point3acres . com / bbs 
Written in the back: My feeling is that fb home is really full, unless it is god-like Daniel may they will be very careful.

This onsite is all very nice people or Americans, did not meet a Asan. Besides round2 people are really too cow i'm too weak no way however
I still think the interviewer is very nice, at least not deliberately want to black or how the whole process of pushing my internal push is very awesome so the Chinese people still
Trying to help each other

My round 3 is the only one-hour interview
That manager is transferred from the academia, because talk was very happy so he interviewed the day immediately took the initiative to send me an e-mail: Very enjoy this discussion
If I want to go to their group Let me save his email for future contact If he does not want to go he will use my manager to help me contact other better match my group
This sign that gave me too many positives is a bit unexpected when I receive a tragedy later
recruiter asked me to give a phone call to provide feedback: that is, the lack of industrial experience, but my own .,
how can I have a lot of general new hire What? Perhaps all this is an excuse to illusion it

45min punctual call
Feel the general surface, although the questions are right, but every time I finish, every time he is hesitant little brother sounds good. I do not know if he is satisfied or not.
I do not know if I can.
Face finished with two rounds of preparation for face-to-face brushing, FB that this company likes to test the original title, but the difficulty of the title slightly larger.
Second, FB for the time complexity of these requirements quite high, usually must be accurate analysis, we must analyze the situation wrost case.

Design Question First gave the classic POI, I said I've seen, and my thoughts and GeoHash said online. Then gave me a Designing Instagram. Are very conventional, design-based. However, I did not find out what the test center is.

I made the title obviously too slow. Because before the interview, HR said Make Sure answer 2 questions for each session, I was one, and I did not get a round of [tears].

In fact, I have already signed the appropriate Offer, FB is trying to test the water, it failed or nothing, may not go. Because of the circulated version of many. From my interview with the interviewer, you can prove: from: 1point3acres . Com / bbs 
1. As with other companies, the questions and ratings are all interviewers' personal behavior, so the questions bank is only relatively useful. The spread of the Internet can not be the whole letter, there is still a lot of luck in it.
2. To do faster than to talk about the important idea is a misunderstanding. Because there are a few Chinese people, I asked about the grading standards. As mentioned above, there is no standard at first. Second, the interviewer will judge the strength according to the actual strength of the interviewer (reaction), rather than the oligarchy, and compare with other interviewers. So I think it is even more reliable CtCI (slightly). .1point3acres Zuxiang

So, if you want security, but also to discuss good ideas, but also a good grasp of time given the speed of the optimal solution. Personally feel that FB time is more stressful, of course, I usually slower (LC race + almost half an hour to complete the look), and then there is hope for training Kazakhstan. .1point3acres 缃
