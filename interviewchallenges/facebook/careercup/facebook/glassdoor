binary tree, find the longest path length in the tree.  
Knight tour problem to find the shortest path to reach a given destination
 returns false if attempting to add a new meeting that overlaps with an already existing meeting. Meetings are defined by a start time and end time
 Iterative in-order traversal 
 2D array with 0 and 1, find islands.  
 SortedIterator - consists of List of Lists with sorted int values in each list. You have to give next sorted value when call next().

have to implement methods
  * constructor
  * next()
  * hasNext()

  [
    [1, 4, 5, 8, 9],
    [3, 4, 4, 6],
    [0, 2, 8]
  ]

  next() -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4...
  The dot product between two sparse arrays. A better solution than O(n). You can pre-process the input.  
  Given a set of numbers, verify that a contingent sum exists that is equal to the input number.

  Given an array of n elements return true if 3 of the sum of 3 elements is equal to a constant c 

Example array a[6,2,3,4] constant c = 9 

if a[1] + [2] + [3] == c return true 

The size of the array is n 

If any set of 3 elements is equal to the constant c, then return false

  Given a string with alpha-numeric characters and parentheses, 
  return a string with balanced parentheses by removing the fewest characters possible. You cannot add anything to the string.

Given a collection of two dimensional points and a number k, return the k closest points to (0,0) by Euclidean distance.

Given a string as input, return the list of all the patterns possible:


'1' : ['A', 'B', 'C'], 
'2' : ['D', 'E'],
'12' : ['X']
'3' : ['P', 'Q']
Example if input is '123', then output should be [ADP, ADQ, AEP, AEQ, BDP, BDQ, BEP, BEQ, CDP, CDQ, CEP, CEQ, XP, XQ]

Move[inplace] the non zero elements at the one end(end of array) and return the numbers of non zero elements in output array

Question 2: Given a number 'k', return the corresponding row, given the pattern: 
k => output 
0 => [] 
1 => ["0", "1", "8"] 
2 => ["00", "11", "69", "96", "88"] 
3 => ["000", "111", "101", "888", ...] // and so on ...

Question 1: Given an input of an array of string, verify if, turned 180 degrees, it is the "same". 
For instance: 
[1, 6, 0, 9, 1] => return true 
[1, 7, 1] => return false
