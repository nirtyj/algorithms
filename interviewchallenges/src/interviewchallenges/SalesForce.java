	/**
	 * Pure Javascript, CSS, QA, BFS, DFS, Sorting, Map-Reduce, Database, System Design, Tree problems
	 * 
	 * here were 3 technical rounds 
	 * and a lunch interview with the team's manage
	 * 
	 * Describe how to architect a web server architecture and list out various control points and security implications
	 * OOPs on a Uber like application
	 * 
	 * Programming questions including implementing rate limiting for a web server and return coin denominations question.
	 * 
	 * Variant of max sum in a binary tree (not a BST).
	 * 
	 * A design question related to scalability
	 * An algorithm question involving binary search tree.
	 * 
	 * QA testing question
	 * LRU cache, merge ranges,
	 * Find the first unique character in a string
	 * Balancing curly brackets, parens, and square brackets 
	 * String manipulation, probability, SQL, sorting, systems design, class implementation, test cases, complexity
	 * 
	 * Front-end, such as html, css and js, to Back-end, such as oo design, SQL, Java language.
	 *  Also, Salesforce also wants developers have a mindset of testing. Therefore, keep some basic testing knowledge as well.
	 *  
	 *  Code high level class hierarchy to implement a Library system that includes Library book checkouts, returns, 
	 *  search based on title, partial title search, author, ISBN and other meta data.
	 *  library fining program that keeps tracks of the fines of individual items in the library based on customer.
	 *  operating system internals, file system internals, computer architecture, distributed systems, coding, data structures, 
	 *  complexity analysis, design choices, past projects and challenges encountered, 
	 *  producer-consumer variations, multi-threaded programming related and such
	 *  
	 *  Interview 1 - Medium level question followed by an extension.
		Lunch - More information about the team and role
		Interview 2 - One easy Tree question and one medium DP question. Nothing unexepected
		Interview 3 - One medium question followed by a lengthy discussion on one of the sorting algorithms. Didn do to well in this interview
		Interview 4 - A basic design question, some design pattern discussion and REST discussion 
		
		understand my interest, why salesforce etc.
		
		Design Dropbox. Design a distrubuted NoSQL. Coding in circular buffer and readN and a bunch of others
		
		Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome
		Find duplicate files.
		counts in word cloud data 
		
		sorting an array
		
		data size, traffic, API, request flow, load balancers, security, session replication, fault tolerance, sharding
		
		Resume, Reverse string (collections & 2 pointers), garbage collector, 
		how hashmap works in java, Find connecting points of 2 linked list, find max path sum for a tree. LeetCode - Medium & easy
		
		sort a list of numbers by the frequency of each number in the list, then optimize it
		
		
		1) programming fundamentals (OOP vs FP, some data structure basics, Java basics etc), 
		2) coding challenge questions + behavioral questions, 
		3) design interview,
		4) distributed systems interview
		
		 on-site interview, each interview consisted of two engineers (one QA and one Dev). 
		 The first 30-40 minutes of each interview consisted of design/algorithm questions and the last 10-15 minutes were focused on QA questions 
		 regarding the designs that I've came up with. 
		 Salesforce has recently combined the QA and Dev roles into one, calling it the 'hybrid' system. 
		 Thus, each interview consisted an engineer from QA and Dev
		 
		 Can you write an algorithm that computes the nth Fibonacci number in linear time or faster?	
		 
		 Creating, handling, and preventing deadlocks and livelocks
		 What's the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
		 How would you implement a Stack if you're given access to a Queue API and only the Queue API? 
		 Use two stacks to implement a queue.
		 Find the median in an unsorted linked list
		 Datacenter/SQL question about joins and ordering  
		 Print out the boundary nodes of a binary tree 
		 
		 rotating a binary tree
